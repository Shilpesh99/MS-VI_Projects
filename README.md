# Sales Data Analysis
Analyze sales data to identify trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics for
business decision-making.

# Data-Source
The Dataset contains more than 100K+ data and Data was presenting the sell of the organization in 2019.

# Methodology
For data cleaning and munching I used Power Query and DAX commands.
For analyzing i used Power BI, I have extract more coloumns an measure for more detailed analysis.

# Key Finding
﻿At 4613443.34, December had the highest Sales and was 153.17% higher than January, which had the lowest Sales at 1822256.73.

# Diabetes Prediction Model
The Diabetes Prediction Project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes 
in individuals based on various health metrics. This project is designed to assist healthcare professionals and 
individuals in early detection and preventive care for diabetes.

# Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Diabetes Dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset includes 
information about various health parameters such as glucose levels, blood pressure, insulin levels, body mass index (BMI), 
and age, among others. It consists of 768 observations with 8 feature variables and a target variable indicating the 
presence or absence of diabetes.

# Methodology
Data Preprocessing:
1. Loaded the dataset and performed exploratory data analysis to understand the data distribution and identify any missing or inconsistent values.
2. Handled missing values and performed feature scaling to standardize the data.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

Model Training:
1. Utilized various machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to train the prediction models.
2. Used cross-validation to tune the hyperparameters and select the best-performing model.

Model Evaluation:
1. Evaluated the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
2. Selected the model with the highest performance metrics for deployment.

# Conclusion
The Diabetes Prediction Project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning in healthcare for predicting 
diabetes. The model achieved high accuracy and reliability in predictions, providing valuable insights for early diagnosis and prevention. This project 
highlights the potential of data analytics and machine learning in transforming healthcare services and improving patient outcomes.
